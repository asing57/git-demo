A text file is a computer file that only contains text and has no special formatting such as bold text, italic text, images, etc. With Microsoft
 Windows computers text files are identified with the . txt file extension, as shown in the example picture.

The following are the graphical (non-control) characters defined by
ISO 8859-1 (1987).  Descriptions in words aren't all that helpful,
but they're the best we can do in text.  A graphics file illustrating
the character set should be available from the same archive as this
file.
